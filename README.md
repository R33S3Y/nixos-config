# Reesey's NIXos Config

This is the repository where I keep my nixos config.

## Disclaimer

This repository is made public purely for my convenience and I will not bother helping any one with it in any form. Of course it is open source so can go crazy and do whatever you want to do with it, just know that I will not be helping you in any way.

Please note that for some reason it seems that you need to commit your changes before it is will to reconize the existance of new files

Also attempted builds can be assumed successful by the fact that you can see them as I only push on success nowdays
